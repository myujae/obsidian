# Opinions

**Why did you apply for the Humanities Scholarship?** 
- Enjoy examining perspectives, assumptions, and moral implications 
- I value discussion and dialogue, not just individual perspectives 
- I can meet a community of thinkers 

**Why study the Humanities, when STEM and technology seem more “useful”?** 
- Humanities are foundational 
- STEM solves problems; the Humanities are essential for guiding them. 
- Humanities develop judgment, empathy, and critical thinking 
- Without ethical judgment and historical awareness, technological progress can create harm even when intentions are good. 
	- ==AI decision-making and bias==
- In a fast-changing world, these soft skills age slower than technical skills 

**What do you hope to gain from this programme that you can’t get elsewhere?** 
- Discussion, workshops (interdisciplinary thinking), exposure to ideas 

**How do you see the Humanities shaping the type of person you want to become?** 
- Curious (critical thinking) — encourages asking why, what’s missing, whose perspective it is 
	- Trains you to question assumptions and sources 
	- Intellectual humility — knowing you don’t know everything 
- Empathy through exposure to lived experiences across time, culture, and identity 
	- Understand people before judging them/their opinions, give you are more complete picture 

**Are the Humanities still relevant in today’s world? Why or why not?** 
- Yes, today’s problems are increasingly human, not just technical. Modern challenges involve ethics, identity, and power
- Rapid change makes historical and cultural perspectives more important, not less — think about consequences, value, nad meaning 
	- ==AI ethics==
	- ==Polarisation and misinformation== 

**What do the Humanities offer that AI or data cannot?** 
- AI processes information while the Humanities teach you to interpret information through ethical and cultural lenses 
- AI can analyse patterns while the Humanities deal with ambiguity, context, and lived experiences 
- Moral responsibility must remain human 

**Do you think society undervalues the Humanities? Why?** 
- Yes, their impact is long-term and intangible, not easily measured 
- Value today is often defined by immediate economic return 
- Humanities outcomes (judgment, empathy, civic responsibility) are hard to quantify. They are visible in the quality of decisions and relationships
- However, this is changing as societies face ethical and social consequences of rapid technological growth 

**Can a society function well without the Humanities?** 
- Can function, but not flourish — systems can operate but justice, cohesion, and meaning suffer 
- Laws and technology need moral and cultural interpretation (eg imagine ==policies that are efficient but dehumanising==)
- Without shared values, societies become fragmented 

**What kind of books do you read, and why?** 
- Recently I’ve been reading more non-fiction to understand systems, power, and social behaviour, and contextualise current events 

**What topics are you interested in?** 
- ==How social structures shape identity and opportunity==

**If you had a year to study anything in the Humanities, what would it be?** 
- Sociology 
- Understand what shapes human behaviour 

**What current issue concerns you the most, and why?** 
- Apathy 
- How misinformation spreads easily in an environment where people don’t always read critically. When information is consumed quickly, it becomes harder to digest it properly and have reasoned discussions. As a student, I see how easy it is to skim rather than think deeply, and that worries me because it’s important for us to understand what’s going on in society 

**Is there a commonly accepted belief you disagree with?** 
- That efficiency and speed always mean progress 
- Efficiency reduces space for reflection and ethical consideration 

**What do you think young people misunderstand about society today?** 
- They underestimate complexity and overestimate simplicity 
- Social issues are often presented as binary when in fact they are grey areas. We know that nothing is set in black or white, nothing is wholly good or bad but this is hard to remember 
- There’s often a desire for clear villains and quick solutions, but real societal change involves trade-offs and long-term effort 

Do you think history repeats itself? 

Is progress always good? 

Should freedom of speech have limits? 

Is empathy something that can be taught? 
# Discussion
Frameworks: 
1. Giving own view: Claim -> Reason -> Example -> Implication 
	“I think the Humanities are still relevant because they help us make value judgments, not just technical ones. For example, AI can decide efficiency, but it can’t decide fairness. Without the Humanities, we risk building systems that work well but harm people.” 

2. Responding to someone else: Agree -> Introduce tension/limitation -> Reframe 
	“I agree that technology has improved access to limitation, but access doesn’t necessarily mean understanding. So perhaps the real issue isn’t how much information we have, but how we interpret and act on it.” 

3. Controversial/polarising issue: Perspective -> Counterpoint -> Explain how both can coexist/where the tension lies  
	“On one hand, free speech is essential for open societies. On the other, unrestricted speech can cause real harm. The challenge is deciding where responsibility begins without undermining freedom.”

4. Hidden assumption worth questioning: Assumption -> Challenge -> Insight 
	“We often assume progress means moving faster. But if progress is about improving lives, then speed without reflection might actually be a step backward.”
