**Why did you apply for the Humanities Scholarship?** 
- Enjoy examining perspectives, assumptions, and moral implications 
- I value discussion and dialogue, not just individual perspectives 
- I can meet a community of thinkers 

**Why study the Humanities, when STEM and technology seem more “useful”?** 
- Humanities are foundational 
- STEM solves problems; the Humanities are essential for guiding them. 
- Humanities develop judgment, empathy, and critical thinking 
- Without ethical judgment and historical awareness, technological progress can create harm even when intentions are good. 
	- AI decision-making and bias  
- In a fast-changing world, these soft skills age slower than technical skills 

**What do you hope to gain from this programme that you can’t get elsewhere?** 
- Discussion, workshops (interdisciplinary thinking), exposure to ideas 

**How do you see the Humanities shaping the type of person you want to become?** 
- Curious (critical thinking), empathetic, thoughtful

# Discussion
Frameworks: 
1. Giving own view: Claim -> Reason -> Example -> Implication 
	“I think the Humanities are still relevant because they help us make value judgments, not just technical ones. For example, AI can decide efficiency, but it can’t decide fairness. Without the Humanities, we risk building systems that work well but harm people.” 

2. Responding to someone else: Agree -> Introduce tension/limitation -> Reframe 
	“I agree that technology has improved access to limitation, but access doesn’t necessarily mean understanding. So perhaps the real issue isn’t how much information we have, but how we interpret and act on it.” 

3. Controversial/polarising issue: Perspective -> Counterpoint -> Explain how both can coexist/where the tension lies  
	“On one hand, free speech is essential for open societies. On the other, unrestricted speech can cause real harm. The challenge is deciding where responsibility begins without undermining freedom.”

4. Hidden assumption worth questioning: Assumption -> Challenge -> Insight 
	“We often assume progress means moving faster. But if progress is about improving lives, then speed without reflection might actually be a step backward.”
