# History

- Plato believed we had a tripartite soul 
	1. Rational (logical): Seeks truth and is swayed by facts and arguments 
	2. Spirited (emotional): How feelings fuel your actions 
	3. Appetitive (physical desires): Drives you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself
# Species of Arguments

	- Entailment: If A is true, B must follow. A necessarily leads to B. 
	- Deductively sound arguments’ premises are all true and is valid -> conclusion guaranteed to be true 
- Inductive 
- Abductive
