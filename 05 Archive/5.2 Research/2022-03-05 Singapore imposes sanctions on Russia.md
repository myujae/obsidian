# Summary 
Singapore departed from its usual practice of following UN Security Council measures by unilaterally imposing sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict, as Russia’s veto prevented UN sanctions. These measures aimed to weaken Russia’s ability to fund the war by restricting exports of military, dual-use, and cyber-related items, and by limiting financial support. Singapore barred its financial institutions from transacting with selected Russian banks, required the freezing of assets (including those linked to cryptocurrencies), and prohibited services that facilitate fundraising for the Russian government or its controlled entities. It also banned the transfer of all military goods and certain dual-use electronics and information security itemss. These sanctions, unchanged since March 2022, prompted Russia to retaliate by adding Singapore to its “Unfriendly Countries List,” subjecting deals with Singapore-linked entities to government approval and allowing debts to foreign creditors from such countries to be repaid in rubles.
